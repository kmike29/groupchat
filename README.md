# groupchat

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

In the app , you can create an account and once you are connected , you can add other users as friends and discuss with them in private messages. You can also create groups and have discussions with more than two people. 

Only an admin can add other users and delegate another admin. If the group is left without admin , one of the remaining member is chosen as an admin.
